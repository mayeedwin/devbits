# Docker Compose: Local Development Paradise

How Docker Compose transformed my local setup from chaos to consistency.

## Before: The Installation Nightmare

"Make sure you have Node 16.8.2, PostgreSQL 13.4, Redis 6.2, and pray your OS is compatible."

## After: One Command Setup

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
    
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
```

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Done. Works on everyone's machine.

## Why I Love Docker Compose

- **Consistent environments** - No more "works on my machine"
- **Easy onboarding** - New developers productive in minutes
- **Service isolation** - Database version locked and contained
- **Quick teardown** - `docker-compose down` cleans everything

One config file to rule them all.
