# CSS Grid: Finally Understanding the Magic

That moment when CSS Grid clicks and you realize you've been fighting layout for years.

## Before Grid: The Dark Ages

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: space-between;
  /* Plus 50 lines of media queries */
}
```

## After Grid: Pure Magic

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

Two lines. Two. Mind = blown.

## Why I Love Grid

- **Intuitive**: Think in rows and columns
- **Responsive**: Auto-fit and minmax are genius
- **Clean**: No more clearfix hacks

Grid isn't just a layout tool, it's a mindset shift.
