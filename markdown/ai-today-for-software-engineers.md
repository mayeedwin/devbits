# Thinking...

> After attending a couple of AI focused sessions at Google I/O Connect 2025, Berlin, here is my reflection so far

Embracing these stages EARLY on has proven right, and to be honest, early adoption has a lot of unknowns but then that's just part of it. Look at mobile phones evolution, how we build apps for the web or mobile, for example - no one had any idea of what best UI/UX would work, too many ideas have evolved over time to incredible experiences we have today.

**That's just it.**

Sofware Engineering has evolved A LOT as well, from **how we write code**, **manage code**, **share code**, **deploy** and **mantain code**, **devices we write with**, **apps we build** and **platforms we build** for - from **platform specific**, to **hybrid** to **multiplartform**, the growth has been intense and amazing!

**Today, with AI, individuals can really focus on what they do best, INNOVATION.**

I use AI daily. AI has become a companion, a buddy and learning partner, the velocity has been great, easy to build at scale, bug-hunting has become a fun sport; LOL - the learning and relearning is greaaaaat!

Don't get me wrong, I DEBATE this new found buddy so much, and it's fun! I have deliberately decied to humanize my day-to-day engagement with the AI (Models I use). And this, Oh-my Oh-my, works! Well, at least for ME!

**By the way, I use Claude Code, and Cursor.**

With every project, task, bug, I have realized that context is KING! Once you contextualize the promting, refactoring, bug fixing and or adding a new feature of whatever size becomes smooooooooth!

In summary, my quick cheat sheet items are;

- Domain knowledge of what you are building
- Have constraits on finger tips
- Best practices are important
- Humanize the prompting

Cheers! Happy & coding!
